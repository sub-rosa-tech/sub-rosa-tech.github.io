Testing

The goal of this article is to add some extra info about blog writing.

Use level 2 `##` and if necessary `###` titles to structure your posts.

You can display a block of code like the following using triple backticks:

```python
def hello(name):
	return f'hello {name}'
```

Create an `assets` folder where you can put all your images then display them with a link starting

`![my inspiring image]({{ "/assets/face.jpg" | relative_url }})`.
![my inspiring image]({{ "/assets/face.jpg" | relative_url }})
